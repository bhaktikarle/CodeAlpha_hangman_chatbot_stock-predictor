# CodeAlpha_hangman_chatbot_stock-predictor

This repository contains beginner to intermediate-level Python projects completed during my internship at CodeAlpha, showcasing practical applications of core programming concepts:

1]Hangman Game: A classic word-guessing game using loops, conditionals, and basic logic.

2]Chatbot: A simple rule-based chatbot that simulates basic conversations using conditional flows.

3]Stock Price Predictor: A basic project demonstrating the use of logic to forecast trends based on input data.

4]Repetitive task automation: Performed a real-life repetitive task of moving .jpg files from one folder to another.



These projects helped reinforce my understanding of Python syntax, logic building, and problem-solving through hands-on coding.
